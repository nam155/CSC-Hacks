## Project Description
Our project aims to develop a model that accurately predicts outcomes of various sporting events. It will involve the use of data, statistics, probability, and machine learning to formulate the model. Both Nick and Andrew have been avid sports fans all of thier life, and passionate about combining this with thier analystical and coding skills. A deeper knowledge of machine learning will be necessary and quite useful. Predictive sports analyicts projects are not easily tackled due to the vast number of variables that can affect a a sporting event; however we are excited for the challenge.
